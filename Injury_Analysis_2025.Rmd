# Injury Analysis 2025

## Introduction

Due to a recent unfortunate accident in South America public concerns about our 
company's workplace safety practicies have been voiced and are requesting 
answers. 

As a global industrial manufacturing company operating internationally, ensuring 
compliance with local industrial regulations has split the company into unique
safety regimes, all of which are under the microscope of the public eye.

### Purpose and Research Questions

The purpose of this report is to perform an analysis of workplace injury data to 
help inform our response to these questions:

1. Of the various safety regimes in place across your company, which one would 
you recommend become the international standard for your company, based solely 
on injury prevention performance?

1. It has been suggested by senior management that industry experience is more 
important than the safety regime when it comes to preventing injuries. His idea 
is that a policy should be developed that is directly related to lowering 
employee turnover will reduce injury rates. Does the 
available data support this assertion?

1. Is there any relationship between:

  - Injuries and the annual bonuses a proportion of employees received  
  - Injuries and whether staff have received any formal external qualifications 
e.g. external safety training or a university degree.

## Summary of the Available Data

The data contains the counts of injuries and hours worked aggregated by the 
experience level of the workers for the last 12 months of operation. Each column 
of the dataset is:

- `record_id` - a **unique key** for the group of workers, by experience level
- `Injuries` - count of injuries in the group 
- `Safety` - the safety regime in place for the group
- `Hours` - the total hours worked by the group
- `Experience` - the experience level of the group
- `bonus` - proportion of the group that recieved an annual bonus last year
- `training` - proportion of the group who have completed external safety 
training
- `university` - proportion of the group who have at least one university degree

### Install and load required R packages:

``` {R}
library(GGally)
library(ggpubr)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Open and read CSV data:

``` {r}
data <- read.csv("injury-3.csv")
```

## Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

After viewing the dataset in its tabular form, it was theorized that there 
could be an interaction between `Injuries` and `Hours` due to colision theory 
where the longer the workers work within the `record_id` the more `Injuries` 
will occur.

Therefore, in addition to the provided dataset, the `Injury` column will be mutated with 
the `Hours` column to provide a standardized, `Injury.Rate` column, equivalant 
to:

$$
\text{Injuries.Rate} = \frac{\text{Injuries}}{\text{Hours}} \times \text{100 000}
$$

``` {r}
data <- data %>% # inplace modification of data dataset
  mutate(Injuries.Rate = (Injuries / Hours) * 100000) # Injuries.Rate = No. Injuries per 100 000 Hours
```


``` {r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
p <- ggpairs(data)
ggsave("figures/ggpairs_data.png", plot = p, dpi = 300, width = 10, height = 10)
p <- ggpairs(data, columns=c(
  "record_id",
  "Injuries",
  "Safety",
  "Hours",
  "Experience",
  "Injuries.Rate"
))
ggsave("figures/ggpairs_data_sigcorr.png", plot = p, dpi = 300, width = 10, height = 10)
```

![](figures/ggpairs_data.png)
![](figures/ggpairs_data_sigcorr.png)

From the above graphs the following interactions have the highest correlation:

- Injuries:record_id*

  Where the number of `Injuries` tends to increase as the `record_id` increases
  as the `record_id`. As the `record_id` is derived from the `Safety` regime and 
  `Experience` of the workers this means that the interaction visible here is 
  coming from both or either `Safety` and `Experience`.

- Safety:record_id***

  As expected, there is an interaction between `Safety` and `record_id` this is 
  due to the `record_id` being an aggregated result from `Safety` and
  `Experience`.

- Safety:Injuries***

  From this, there is a correlation between the `Safety` and the number of 
  `Injuries` from the rough correlation scale '***', this is a significant 
  correlation that may indicate that some Safety regimes are better than others 
  at preventing injury, or it could also indicate that some Safety regimes may 
  classify different things as an injury and as such will be reported or not 
  reported as such.

- Hours:Injuries***

  This somewhat credits the assumption that as `Hours` increased the `Injuries` 
  would also increase, which is why `Injuries.Rate` was created to reduce the 
  affectes of collision theory, where the longer the workers worked in a record, 
  the more `Injuries` would occur.

- Hours:Safety***

  This is interesting, `ggpairs` has detected a correlation between the number 
  of `Hours` in a `record_id` and the `Safety` regime in-place, suggesting that
  some `Safety` reigme's have different requirments on how long workers can  
  work.

- Injuries.Rate:Experience***

  There is also a correlation between the calculated `Injuries.Rate` and the 
  workers `Experience`, referring to the image, this is a strong negative 
  correlation, therefore, as expected, as the workers are more experienced 
  within the group, the less injuries occur.
  
### `Injuries` and `record_id` interaction

As identified above, the number of `Injuries` appears to interact with 
`record_id`, however, it is the least significant of the whole list of 
interactions. After manually inspecting the tabular raw data a weird pattern 
emerges with how the `record_id` was selected, the pattern is as follows:

- `Safety` is broken into 2 repeated groups 1 - 4 and 1 - 4 again
- for each value of `Safety`, `Experience` goes from 4 - 1
- as `record_id` increases, `Safety` increases until 4 and then starts 
again at 1

This pattern can also be seen from the ggpairs plots where the `Injuries` 
increases in repeating patterns for the `Injuries`:`record_id` interaction.

While, `record_id` isn't that significant in itself, the patterns emerging from it
suggest there is a 2-way interaction for:

$$
\text{Injuries} = \beta_0+\beta_1\cdot\text{Experience}+\beta_2\cdot\text{Safety}+\beta_3\cdot(\text{Experience}\cdot\text{Safety})
$$
This can be tested with the `lm()` function:

```{r}
model <- lm(Injuries ~ Experience * Safety, data = data)
summary(model)
```
