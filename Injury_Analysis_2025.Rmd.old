# Injury Analysis 2025

## Introduction

Due to a recent unfortunate accident in South America public concerns about our 
company's workplace safety practicies have been voiced and are requesting 
answers. 

As a global industrial manufacturing company operating internationally, ensuring 
compliance with local industrial regulations has split the company into unique
safety regimes, all of which are under the microscope of the public eye.

### Purpose and Research Questions

The purpose of this report is to perform an analysis of workplace injury data to 
help inform our response to these questions:

1. Of the various **safety regimes** in place across your company, which one would 
you recommend become the international standard for your company, based solely 
on injury prevention performance?

1. It has been suggested by senior management that industry **experience** is more 
important than the safety regime when it comes to preventing injuries. His idea 
is that a policy should be developed that is directly related to lowering 
employee turnover will reduce injury rates. Does the 
available data support this assertion?

1. Is there any relationship between:

  - Injuries and the annual **bonuses** a proportion of employees received  
  - Injuries and whether staff have received any formal external **qualifications** 
e.g. external safety training or a university degree.

## Summary of the Available Data

The data contains the counts of injuries and hours worked aggregated by the 
experience level of the workers for the last 12 months of operation. Each column 
of the dataset is:

- `record_id` - a **unique key** for the group of workers, by experience level
- `Injuries` - count of injuries in the group 
- `Safety` - the safety regime in place for the group
- `Hours` - the total hours worked by the group over the 12 month period
- `Experience` - the experience level of the group
- `bonus` - proportion of the group that recieved an annual bonus last year
- `training` - proportion of the group who have completed external safety 
training
- `university` - proportion of the group who have at least one university degree

### Install and load required R packages:

``` {R}
# code credit to: https://statsandr.com/blog/an-efficient-way-to-install-and-load-r-packages/

# Package names
packages <- c("GGally", "ggpubr", "tidyverse", "backports")

# Install packages not yet installed
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

# Packages loading
invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))
```

### Open and read CSV data:

``` {r}
data <- read.csv("injury-3.csv")
```

## Data Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

As the data explains, the `record_id` is simply a unique id for the record of 
data stored it doesn't extend the data but simply uses `Safety` and `Experience`
to group the data into more manageable chunks. Therefore, it will be ignored in 
the analysis.

Initially, ggpairs is used with `na.omit(data)` to inspect if any 
multicolinearity exists and if any relationships are immediately obvious.

``` {r}
p <- ggpairs(na.omit(data))
ggsave("figures/ggpairs_data.png", plot = p, dpi = 300, width = 10, height = 10)
```

![](figures/ggpairs_data.png)

From the above graphs the following interactions have the highest correlation:

- Injuries:record_id*

  Where the number of `Injuries` tends to increase as the `record_id` increases
  as the `record_id`. As the `record_id` is derived from the `Safety` regime and 
  `Experience` of the workers this means that the interaction visible here is 
  coming from both or either `Safety` and `Experience`.

- Safety:record_id***

  As expected, there is an interaction between `Safety` and `record_id` this is 
  due to the `record_id` being an aggregated result from `Safety` and
  `Experience`.

- **Safety**:Injuries***

  From this, there is a correlation between the `Safety` and the number of 
  `Injuries` from the rough correlation scale '***', this is a significant 
  correlation that may indicate that some Safety regimes are better than others 
  at preventing injury, or it could also indicate that some Safety regimes may 
  classify different things as an injury and as such will be reported or not 
  reported as such.

- Hours:Injuries***

  This positive correlation makes sense as the longer the workers work, the 
  longer they are exposed to risk which may cause injury. It could also mean 
  that as the workers get more fatigued, they may make mistakes, leading to 
  injury.

- Hours:**Safety*****

  This is interesting, `ggpairs` has detected a correlation between the number 
  of `Hours` in a `record_id` and the `Safety` regime in-place, suggesting that
  some `Safety` reigme's have different requirements on how long workers can  
  work. This interaction should be investigated when looking into the first 
  research question.

With this, R is used to fit a linear model using all the variables in the \
dataset

```{r}
model <- lm(Injuries ~ Safety * Hours + Experience, data = na.omit(data))
summary(model)
```
